        I am Juan Baltazar, a first-generation rising senior studying Mathematics and Computer Science at Eastern Connecticut University. I have always enjoyed problem solving, being technical, and actively learning. These three passions have led me to pursue a career as a software engineer in the tech industry.

        My name is Huda Mahad and I'm a rising senior at the Ohio State University. My major is Computer & Information Sciences with a focus on Software Engineering. I'm interested in software engineering, software and web development, and cybersecurity. This is my first web development project and so I chose this project to get some experience and learn new transferable skills.

        My name is Jose Gavidia and I am a rising Senior studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Davis. I'd realized I enjoy programming and problem solving after taking my first promming class, Programming C++, which is why I'd decided to study computer science. I'd decided to work on this project because, although I had no experience in web-development, I was eager to learn something new and strengthen my teamwork skills.

        I'm Alejandro Ojeda-Celis, a soon to be senior at the University of Texas at Arlington studying computer science. I hope to make it into the video games industry in order to create games that change people's lives like they did with mine. This project of the blog website will help with foundational computer science skills and having the ability to work with a great team has taught me a lot.
